# Tortoise-tts-fastest-colab-error
This is the fastest tortoise tts voice cloner, but it is throwing an error. I've demonstrated the error here. "RuntimeError: Expected tensor for argument #1 'indices' to have one of the following scalar types: Long, Int; but got torch.cuda.FloatTensor instead (while checking arguments for embedding)" If anyone knows how to fix it, add a comment here:
